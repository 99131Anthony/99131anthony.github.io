    <p> style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">Inside the black box is a collection of water that is already inside to explain why more water comes out then what we put in. </p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>Most of the trials we conducted with the black box would result in more water coming out then what we put in. Some outliers were that no water came out at all or less water came out. Our model did produce much results, the water would like out and not make it to the bucket. The data weâ€™re using is the original data from the original black box.
