    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>Inside the black box is a collection of water that is already inside to explain why more water comes out then what we put in. </p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>Most of the trials we conducted with the black box would result in more water coming out then what we put in. Some outliers were that no water came out at all or less water came out. Our model did produce much results, the water would like out and not make it to the bucket. The data we’re using is the original data from the original black box.
</p>
    
    <h1>Reasoning Part 1</h1>
    <p>Models help us test claims and answer possible questions using science and observation.</p>
    
     <h1>Reasoning Part 2</h1>
    <p>The evidence supports the claim by showing more water is coming out than in. We can’t just make water out of thin air so there has to be water already inside the box.</P>
    <p>When we first put water into the black box more water came out than expected. The only other opening in the box is the tube pouring the water out.</p>
     <p>There is no way anymore water can get inside from the outside while we pour the water into the funnel, so water must already be inside.</p>  
  
  
    <h1>Reasoning Part 3</h1>  
    <p>Water travels in a single tube to then come out towards the bottom opening. If this were true then the same amount of water should always come out at the bottom.</p>
